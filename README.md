**Welcome to TO-DO list App!**

This web application is made mostly with PHP (v8.0.10), then with:

- MySQL 5.7 (MariaDB v10.4.21)
- VanillaJS, HTML, CSS
- Smarty PHP Template Engine (v3.1.39) 
- A bit of Vue.js (v2.6.14), used to render the SPA (I learned some of Vue's basic concepts a week ago, that’s why I don’t use Vue’s more complex components).
- Bootstrap framework (v5.0)

It was deployed and tested on XAMPP web server (v8.0.10), on my Ubuntu 20.04 OS.

**To keep in mind**

- Login feature: The initial login page is built by server-side rendering (browser reloads before showing the to-do list SPA).

- I haven’t used other different frameworks or libraries yet, that’s why I chose these technologies. If you need, I’m willing to explain how the site works behind (or display the UI to you, if you can’t run it).

If you have any doubt (or whatever), please let me know.
